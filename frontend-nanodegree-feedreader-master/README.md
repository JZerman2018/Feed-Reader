# Project Overview

This project will enhance skills relevant to testing during the development process. During "test-driven development" developers write tests first, before they start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass. This project entails a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## What will I learn?

I will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

# Testing the Feed Reader Project

How to run this test:

Option-1 - Easy:
Click "Clone in Desktop" / "Download ZIP" in the repository at https://github.com/JZerman2018/Feed-Reader.git
Open the folder
Open index.html in your preferred browser
There will be several test results at the bottom of the screen that says "~ specs, ~ failures"


Option-2 Using Terminal and Node.js:
Pre-requisite : Install node.js, npm, and git
Clone the repository. Open your terminal and run git clone https://github.com/JZerman2018/Feed-Reader.git
Install http-server by npm install -g http-server
Then run http-server in terminal inside the root of the cloned repo.
Go to the URL http://localhost:8080/ in browser.
